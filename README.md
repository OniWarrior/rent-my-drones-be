# rent-my-drones-be
This is going to be the back end to the rent my drones app I'm creating.
I'll make sure to have proper documentation for this project.
I also want to be clear that this entire project is mainly to hone my front end and back end skills. This app will not be put
to market.

# npm i
Install all packages for dependencies and development

# Testing -- npm run test

Set up local testing database via pgAdmin.
Then, cd into api and into __tests__. Once in __tests__ enter npm run test in terminal to run tests.
